# Project aim 

Creating an rock-paper-scissors like game with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

Of course, with a Japanese theme for some individuality.

# Learning Takeaways and Cool New Technology 

- Learned DOM manipulation and how to make otherwise boring HTML and CSS pages interactive. 
- Honed graphic design skills in creating an UI, obtaining skils rivaling that of Rembrandt 
- Subtle details like a box shadow, a transform on hover, font, and color scheme have dramatic impacts 
- People notice flaws even if they can't figure out what those flaws specifically are 
- Used breakpoints to make page interactive on both half-screen and fullscreen 
- Made code much more concise 
- Coding is a lot more fun once you stop worrying about syntax 

# Other notes 

index.html is the older console game. scissors.html contains the newer UI and better code. 

# Other nutrients influencing my current thought patterns 

Watching the Art of Code and reading Steve Job's biography. 

What makes a great UI great? What makes a product amazing? 

I am learning.
